# Birdwatch

Page will be updated more in-depth if/when the project progresses more. 

## License

The project is licensed under the GNU GPLv3 License, outlined in the LICENSE file. This may later change, but I plan to release the game for free and make the code publically available for other Godot developers to look at, learn from, and (potentially) mod so long as they don't profit from it (i.e. use it commercially).
